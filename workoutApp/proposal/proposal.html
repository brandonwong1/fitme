            However, getting to a desired fitnes level and maintaining it is not an easy feat. In addition, staying fit can be costly at times.

            Anyone can use the app, as one of the driving purposes for it is to create a positive, personalized experience for individual users.
            However, the recommended age to start bodybuilding is from late teens to early twenties, as the age is linked to time for muscle growth.
            We see the age to range of majority of the users accessing the website to be late teens to younger adults in their mid-late 20s.
        </p>

        <h2>Provided Information</h2>
        <p>
            Information users will view are details about recommended workout products, meal plans, and workout plans.
            For example, the app will give users recipes and nutritional contents in the meal plan, exercises will have
            descriptions on proper technique along with benefits/specific muscle groups they target.
        </p>

        <h2>User App Interaction</h2>
        <p>
            Users will be able to take a personalized quiz in order to tailor the website to their needs. Quizzes taken can help users find personalized workout plans, meal plans, and recommended workout products. Users will also be able to input goals they would like to achieve and use it as a performance tracker.

        </p>

        <h2>Addressing the Problem</h2>
        <p>
            By using our app, users will have confidence to workout, which lowers the current barriers that exist for new bodybuilders. Many workout websites currently are generalized and don’t have content that meets users’ needs exactly so our app will allow for users to see more meaningful content. People go into working out for many reasons and not just body building, so personalizing the site will allow users to relate more with the content being shown and possibly keep them more motivated to follow through with their goals.
